this is not a repo to build 1500 account bot upvote network, because for every account you need a CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET of that account from https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps

Setup credentials.env with account username/passwords, CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, setup proxies in proxy.env, public proxies will be fine I guess. App will ask you how many proxy and account you have set in the startup. 

Setup post.env with post ID from link.

I dont even know if this is fully functional, this is just something that came out of total boredom.
